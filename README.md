### Project Choice: 
Audio Book Recommendation App

### Project Inspriation: 
As a user, I always have trouble with finding good audio books I'm interested. So I decided to developed an app for myself. This app will provided recommendations on audio books as well as making your own audio book list.

### Project Description:
An app that allows you to find, make a post on recommending or criticizing a book and browse other people’s recommendations or critics.

### Key Features:
#### Search:
This app will allow guest or AUU users input keywords and the return a list of books'name contains the keywords. For each book, we wll have **Name, Author, Category, Description**, provided for users.

#### Make post:
This app will also allow gest or AUU users to browse other people's posts, and will allow AUU users to make a booklist saved at their account and posted to the public. So that they can have access to their own booklist as well as see other people's recommendations. They can thumb-up or thumb-down on pther people's posts if they want.

### User Stories:

### Next step:
* Based on the data model we designed and the data we collect from users. Net step, we can do a "Filter feature" based on book category, so that users will be abe to scan the information more easily. 
* We can also use the number of likes to do a ratng system (although, this may change require small change on data model)
