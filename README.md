### Project Choice: 
Audio Book Recommendation App

### Project Inspriation: 
As a user, I always have trouble with finding good audio books I'm interested. So I decided to developed an app for myself. This app will provided recommendations on audio books as well as making your own audio book list.

### Project Description:
An app that allows you to find, make a post on recommending or criticizing a book and browse other people’s recommendations or critics.

### Key Features:
#### Search:
This app will allow guest or AUU users input keywords and the return a list of books'name contains the keywords. For each book, we wll have **Name, Author, Category, Description**, provided for users.

#### Make post:
This app will also allow gest or AUU users to browse other people's posts, and will allow AUU users to make a audio book list saved at their account and posted to the public. So that they can have access to their own audio book list as well as see other people's recommendations. They can thumb-up or thumb-down on other people's posts if they want.

### User Stories:
* ✅ As a guest user or AUU, I want to browse other people’s recommendations on audio books including the rating/comments etc. So that I can get some recommendations from other people when I don’t know what to listen to.
* ✅ As a guest user I want to be able to sign up so that I can log in the app and make my own post in the future.
* ✅ As an AUU, I want to be able to add a new post about a book I want to recommend.
* ✅ As an AUU, I want to save the audio book name, author, category, my rating on the book, and comments I have for the audio book for each post I make.
* ✅ As an AUU, I want to be able to see all of my audio book recommendation posts as a list.
* ✅ As an AUU, I want to be able to edit my previous audio book recommendation post.
* ✅ As an AUU, I want to be able to delete any of my previous audio book recommendation posts.
* ✅ As an AUU, I want to be able to thumb up other people’s posts/recommendations.
* ✅ As a guest user or AUU, I want to search for some key words and the App will recommend audio books that contain the keyword. 


### Next step:
* Based on the data model we designed and the data we collect from users. Net step, we can do a "Filter feature" based on book category, so that users will be abe to scan the information more easily. 
* We can also use the number of likes to do a rating system (although, this may change require small change on data model)
